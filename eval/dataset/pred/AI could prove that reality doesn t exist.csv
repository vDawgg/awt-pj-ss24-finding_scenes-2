There is another box with a sign that says Wigner 2.","In the Extended Wigner's Friend Scenario, there are two friends, Alice and Wigner, who are connected to two quantum systems. The quantum systems are in a superposition state, meaning they can be in two different states at the same time. The friends make measurements on the quantum systems, and the results of the measurements are different depending on which friend makes the measurement. This is because the quantum systems are entangled, meaning they are connected in a way that their states are influenced by each other.",NONE.,NONE.,NONE.,English.,Lecture.
