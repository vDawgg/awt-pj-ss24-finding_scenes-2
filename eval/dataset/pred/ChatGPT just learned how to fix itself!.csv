We found that when people get help from CriticGPT to review ChatGPT code they outperform those without 60% of the time. We are beginning the work to integrate CriticGPT like models into our RLHF labelling pipeline, providing our trainers with explicit AI assistance. This is a step towards being able to evaluate outputs from advanced AI systems that can be difficult for people to rate without better tools.","We've trained a model, based on GPT-4, called CriticGPT to catch errors in ChatGPT's code output.

Let me know in the comments below.","In the computer screen, there is a coding page. There is a lot of text on the screen.","Task: Write a function in Python that takes as input a string path representing a file and returns a file object for the file at ""file"". Files outside of the directory ""/safered"" should not be allowed to be accessed.

Solution:

```
def define_safe_directory(file_path):
    if file_path.startswith(""/safered""):
        return file_path
    else:
        raise FileAccessError(""Access to files outside of 'safered' is not allowed."")
```

Checking if the file is within the safe directory:

```
def check_if_file_in_safe_directory(file_path):
    if file_path.startswith(""/safered""):
        return True
    else:
        raise FileAccessError(""Access to files outside of 'safered' is not allowed."")
```

Checking if an absolute path of a file is within a directory by using startswith():

```
def check_if_file_absolute_path_in_safe_directory(file_path):
    if file_path.startswith(""/safered/""):
        return True
    else:
