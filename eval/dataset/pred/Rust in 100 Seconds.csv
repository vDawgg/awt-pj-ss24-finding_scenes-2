It was originally developed as a side project by Graydon Hoare and was later sponsored by Mozilla. Rust provides a garbage collector to manage memory, but it achieves memory safety by taking a different approach. It has no garbage collector, but achieves memory safety by ensuring that memory is allocated and deallocated manually. Rust is a popular choice for building game engines, databases, and other critical systems where performance is absolutely critical.",NONE.,NONE,NONE.,English.,Lecture
