She mentions how a group of physicists is claiming reality doesn't exist by using AI and quantum computers. She expresses her opinion that such ideas are nonsensical. The scene uses pictures to depict the topics she is talking about.",00:00:00.000

The new paper is a follow-up to this older paper.",00:00:30.480

She then explains that in the most common interpretation of quantum mechanics, the outcome of a measurement is not determined, and the theory only makes probabilistic predictions that the measurement has specific values.",00:00:38.600

A measurement is the interaction with a device known as a detector. The majority of physicists believe that a measurement is not a physical process. This issue was notably described by Eugene Wigner.",00:01:35.240

This is referred to as Wigner's friend experiment. The problem arises because the person in the room, before communicating the result, is also in a superposition of states. A complication of the experiment is that there are multiple such thought experiments involving two devices, people in rooms, and entangled particles.",00:02:21.400

Next to her in the video, there are screenshots of the headlines. She explains that if people can exist in superposition, then there is no objective external reality.",00:03:56.440

One is that there is no human-level artificial intelligence, and the other is that quantum computers don't exist capable of running such an AI. The larger problem is that it does not make any sense due to no intelligence being needed to make a measurement, only a detector, and there being no collapse, thus no measurement. She then explains why she is making the video and how larger nervous systems can determine whether superposition is maintained. She discusses how quantum systems above a certain size cannot remain in superposition. Understanding this could solve the measurement problem. Finally, she delivers an emotional speech about science solving problems, followed by an advertisement for Brilliant.",00:05:01.560
