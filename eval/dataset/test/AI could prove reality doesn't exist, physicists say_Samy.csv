She asserts that scientists are claiming reality doesn't exist. She remarks that she wishes it were a joke, especially given their intention to use quantum computers. What troubles her the most, she explains, is her struggle to comprehend how these individuals genuinely believe in such a notion",00:00:00.000

However, as a physicist, one must take such questions seriously. She mentions having previously made a video about this topic, but now she revisits it within the context of quantum theory, saying that a measurement does not determine reality; instead, it only produces outcomes upon measurement.",00:00:38.600

This is known as the measurement problem, which is the origin of the idea that reality does not exist. The video highlights that while one can formally define what a detector is and understand that it performs measurements, most physicists are not in agreement on the specifics. Many physicists believe that measurement is not a purely physical process. This issue was notably described by Eugene Wigner.",00:01:35.240

This is referred to as Wigner's friend experiment. In the scenario, Wigner tries to determine the position of a particle, whether it is left or right, by asking the person in the room after the measurement. The problem arises because the person in the room, before communicating the result, is also in a superposition of states. The video further explains that there are multiple such thought experiments involving two devices, people in rooms, and entangled particles.",00:02:21.400

She explains that a man named Brukner proved that in a fully extended Wigner's friend scenario, all four observers cannot agree on the outcome of the experiment.",00:03:36.080

In this scene, the woman explains that all these headlines originate from the thought experiment. She states that if we assume people can exist in a superposition, we must conclude that there is no objective external reality, as it depends on whom we ask. This idea is what she discusses in the video.",00:03:56.440

A larger issue arises regarding the inconsistency in the information being presented. Initially, she argues that making a measurement doesn't require intelligence, only a detector, and if the measurement doesn't collapse the superposition, it isn't considered a measurement. However, the person in the video claims this notion is nonsensical. She then explains why she's making the video, focusing on how larger nervous systems can determine whether superposition is maintained. She discusses how quantum systems above a certain size cannot remain in superposition. Understanding this could solve the measurement problem. Finally, she delivers an emotional speech about science solving problems, followed by an advertisement for Brilliant.",00:05:01.560
