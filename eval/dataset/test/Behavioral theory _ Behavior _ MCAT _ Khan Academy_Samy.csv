It describes personality as an outcome of interactions between an individual and their environment. The narrator illustrates this with a stick figure representing the individual and symbolically, a tree or several houses representing the environment. Two islands connected by a bridge depict the theory's basis on observable, measurable aspects versus the psychoanalytical theory's focus on the opposite mental behaviors.

The narrator introduces two key figures in Behavioral Theory: Skinner, associated with operant conditioning theory where behaviors are reinforced or punished to achieve desired outcomes, and Pavlov, known for classical conditioning where an unrelated stimulus is paired with a response to elicit an involuntary reaction. An example used is Pavlov's dog associating a bell with food, eventually salivating at the sound of the bell alone.

Both Skinner and Pavlov believe that behavior is influenced by the environment, with Skinner focusing on observable behaviors and Pavlov on conditioned responses. The narrator then discusses how our surroundings continually shape our personal behavior throughout our lives. The question arises: why is there a bridge connecting these two theoriesï¿½the observable and the mental? It's not about one being true and the other false, but rather two different approaches to understanding personality.

The bridge symbolizes the Cognitive Theory, acting as a connector between observational learning and psychoanalytical theory, both contributing to our understanding of behavior as a form of personality.",00:00:01.167
