Following that, a definition of morality by John Deigh is presented, emphasizing that ethics has a different character compared to other sciences because it is normative in nature. Unlike anthropology, which is descriptive, ethics does not determine what one should do but rather describes. Various illustrations are shown, and then questions are posed, which are subsequently addressed throughout the video.",00:00:46.567

He compares moral statements to truth claims like ""2 + 2 = 5"" or ""the Earth is larger than Mars,"" illustrating how determining their truth or falsehood is straightforward compared to moral statements, which are more complex. Those who deny that morality has truth value are called moral subjectivists, arguing that morality merely reflects personal preferences or rational decisions. The next position he describes is moral realism, where proponents believe that morality does possess truth value. He then delves into David Hume's ""is-ought problem,"" which questions whether normative statements can logically follow from descriptive statements.",00:02:40.000

Most philosophers agree that one cannot derive an ""ought"" from an ""is,"" following Hume's assertion that we cannot derive a moral obligation from a mere statement of fact.

Following this, the narrator introduces another important distinction between normative theories: theological vs. deontological ethical theories, presented in blue text on a white background. A quote by Robert Almeder is displayed, which underscores this differentiation. The narrator then proceeds to explain that in theological theories, actions are evaluated based on their purpose, derived from the Greek concept of ""telos.""",00:04:19.533

For instance, figures like Plato and Epicurus have proposed teleological theories.
Next, he introduces the deontological theory rooted in Greek ethics, which emphasizes duty (the term ""Deon"" means duty in Greek). Deontologists believe that the moral worth of an action is not determined by its consequences but rather by the action itself. This distinction is depicted on a blue background with white text.
The narrator explains in the video that deontological theories originate from Jewish or Christian concepts of divine law, often associated with the idea of the Holy Law. It's important to note that not all deontological theories follow this exact structured framework.",00:06:55.767

He mentions philosophers who were skeptical about this, such as Kant, highlighting the challenges with a quote. This is visually emphasized with an image of Kant alongside his quote. Additionally, Arthur Schopenhauer's quote asserts that virtue cannot be taught.",00:08:20.000
