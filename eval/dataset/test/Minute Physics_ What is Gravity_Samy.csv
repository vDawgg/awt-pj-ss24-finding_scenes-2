The concept of gravity is further clarified as a force that attracts all bodies with mass. Using drawn stick figures, suns, and planets, the video illustrates the effects of gravity, such as the Earth's orbit and the formation of planets.",00:00:00.000

He goes on to explain that Newton discovered the strength of gravity decreases with the square of the distance between objects.",00:00:25.417

The narrator continues with stick figure illustrations, explaining that the greater the mass, the stronger the gravitational force. Therefore, we feel the gravity of the Earth but not of the Moon. Nonetheless, the Moon's gravitational force is strong enough to cause tides",00:00:43.250

The narrator then elaborates with stick figure illustrations that gravity not only attracts mass but also objects with energy.",00:01:06.667
